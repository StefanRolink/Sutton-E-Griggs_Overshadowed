			<p>“John Wysong, you will please call at my office at the noon hour.”</p>
			<p>The foreman of the Bilgal Iron Works, a white man, addressed these words to John Wysong, Erma’s brother, at work in these shops as you have been told. John’s heart gave a joyous bound, as he felt sure that he would be informed that he had been reported on account of the splendid record he had worked so hard to make. John had received enough of Erma’s confidence to guess the remainder of her secret, and he was working doubly hard to make a good record and to receive a promotion so that he could earn money the faster to pay off the mortgage on their little home, sell it, and let Erma go off to school by means of the proceeds of the sale. The mortgage was now overdue, but the holder was a kindhearted man, well known to John’s father and mother, and no uneasiness was felt on that score. But John and Erma were very anxious to pay it off for the reason named above. So John experienced much joy between eight o’clock and twelve, after being spoken to by the foreman. He was saying to himself, “After all, it was well for me to have sacrificed a literary education in order to learn a trade, for teaching is now an overcrowded profession and there is nothing else in that line to do. Now, I think I am about to be promoted and will then get four dollars per day. I <i>know</i> I am going to be promoted, for there are only two reasons for which men are called to the office as I was, either to be promoted or turned off. I am glad that my record has been such that I know I won’t be turned off. That was a bully thing in me to stand at the head of the list for the last quarter.” John went on with his work, whistling and singing and planning great things out of his four dollars per day.</p>
			<p>The noon hour came and John went hurriedly to the office of the foreman. He looked so grave that John had some slight misgivings that all was not going to go so well. The foreman was busy arranging some papers, and did not speak at once. At length he said, “John, you have been a good faithful workman and we have all liked both you and your work, you have been so polite, industrious, punctual and painstaking.”</p>
			<p>John felt reassured by these words and said, “Thank you. Thank you, indeed. I certainly have striven hard to deserve your good opinion.”</p>
			<p>When John was through, the foreman resumed, “But I am very sorry to say that I have bad news for you.”</p>
			<p>John’s hat, which he was holding in his hands, dropped to the floor and he grew weak from the shock of disappointment. He said to himself, “I am not promoted. I shall have to work along at the same old figure.”</p>
			<p>The foreman paused before delivering the next blow. “The bad news that I have to tell you, John, is that you cannot work for us any more.”</p>
			<p>“Who has been lying to you on me? Let me face my accuser,” said John aroused, excited.</p>
			<p>“No one has spoken ill of you, John. There is not a man in the shop but is your friend. It is not that we find fault with your work that you have to go.”</p>
			<p>“What on earth then is it?” asked John.</p>
			<p>“The Labor Union has ordered us to discharge you.”</p>
			<p>“The Labor Union! I thought that the Bilgal works belonged to <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Morrison and Brown.”</p>
			<p>“They do, John, they do. But it is this way. The Labor Union will order all of its members throughout the country to quit working for any shop that will employ any man to work who is not a member of the Union. All of the men in our shop, except yourself, belong to the organization, and it has sent us word that they will be called out on a strike unless you are discharged. You see you are not a member and they will not let their members work with nonunion men.”</p>
			<p>“Is that all there is to the matter? Why, I will just join the Union, then; that will settle the whole matter.”</p>
			<p>The foreman smiled a sad sort of smile, saying, “I wish you could, John, I wish you could. But you cannot. You are a colored man.”</p>
			<p>John dropped into the seat nearest him and he felt his heart rising up into his throat as though to choke him. He said in a husky sort of voice, “I suppose you will give me a recommendation, will you not?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, John, with the seal of the firm affixed. But it will do you no good to have it. This Union controls all the shops in the land, and what you meet here you will meet everywhere.”</p>
			<p>John struggled to his feet and, picking up his hat, pulled it down over his eyes and ran his hands into his pants’ pockets. He then looked upon the foreman like a lion at bay. He said in a voice that creaked with the emotion of desperation, “Must I finish the day?”</p>
			<p>“No, John,” said the foreman. “We were ordered to get rid of you before one o’clock today. We put it off till the last moment. John, before you go, let me inform you of something. For some cause or other you have a powerful enemy somewhere⁠—a white man. Our men did not report you. They all liked you and were sorry that you were reported. But we cannot help ourselves. Good day, John. Watch that enemy.”</p>
			<p>John walked moodily homeward and when he arrived, found Erma there. This astonished him as it was about the hour for her to be busy at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner’s. Forgetting all about himself, he said, “Erm, how is this, darling, I find you at home?”</p>
			<p>“John, I have been discharged!” said Erma, falling on his shoulder and bursting into tears. Erma, sobbing, said, “<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Turner drove me out of her house as though I was a dog. She dared me to apply for employment anywhere else in Richmond; and she would not even tell me why I was discharged. And I was doing so well, too. Franzetta was aiding me so much in my studies.”</p>
			<p>John did what he could to soothe Erma. As soon as he thought it was safe, he told her of his own misfortune. They sat upon the sofa with their hands clasped, silent. The road of life was becoming rugged. The mail man’s whistle blew and Erma went to the door and was handed a letter which, upon being opened, told of the foreclosure of the mortgage on their home. Erma looked at John and John looked at Erma.</p>
			<p>Dolly Smith was carrying out her promise.</p>
			<p>A party had approached the original holder of the mortgage with a view to the purchase thereof. The mortgagee disposed of his claim after being assured that the purchaser would deal leniently with John and Erma. This pledge was unscrupulously broken and John and Erma were soon turned adrift upon the streets, penniless and homeless. Erma remembered Aunt Mollie’s invitation and went to dwell with her. John went to a lumber yard for shelter at night.</p>
